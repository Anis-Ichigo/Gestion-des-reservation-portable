When you communicate with someone through our services, we keep your data for a period of 3 years from the time your request is sent. After this period, we will delete the data from the communications. If your data is needed after this period for analytical, historical or other legitimate business purposes, we will take appropriate steps to anonymize it.</p>
<h2>9 - Accessing and updating your personal data and complaints</h2>
<p align='justify'>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you. You may write to us to request a copy of other personal data we hold about you.
Please include any details that will help us to identify you and locate your personal data. Access to your data, where we are able to offer it, is free of charge. We want to ensure that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and up-to-date. If any of the information we hold is not correct, please inform the school of your course.
You may also request to rectify or delete your personal data, object to its processing and, where technically possible, request that the personal data provided be transferred to another organization. Nevertheless, this opposition will only be taken into account by the platform of the tool, and not by the other organizations that have it, such as the university in particular. <br><br>
We will update or delete your data, unless we are required to retain it for legitimate business or legal purposes.
You may also contact us if you have a complaint about how we collect, store or use your personal data. We make every effort to resolve complaints, but if you are not satisfied with our response, you may file a complaint with your local data protection authorities: https://www.cnil.fr/fr/plaintes.
Please submit your request or complaint in writing to the Data Protection Officer (DPO) on plain paper (preferably in R.A.R.) indicating:<p>
<ul>    <li>Your first and last name;</li>
<li>Your mailing address;</li>
<li>Your email address;</li>
<li>Your phone number;</li>
<li>The grounds for your complaint;</li>
</ul>
To the address:<br>
Toulouse 1 Capitole University, <br>
2 Rue Gabriel Marty <br>
31042 Toulouse <br>
France <br> <br>
Or by email to XXX@ut-capitole.fr <br> <br>
We would like to emphasize that we need to verify your identity before processing your request or complaint. We may ask you for more information in order to ensure that you are authorized to make such a request or complaint when you contact us on behalf of another person.<br><br>");
